    "CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) - это библиотека машинного обучения для градиентного бустинга на деревьях решений. Она была разработана компанией Яндекс и имеет ряд преимуществ в сравнении с другими алгоритмами бустинга, такими как XGBoost и LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Одно из главных преимуществ CatBoost заключается в том, что она автоматически обрабатывает категориальные признаки, не требуя их предварительной обработки. Кроме того, она имеет встроенные методы обработки пропущенных значений и автоматический подбор гиперпараметров. Также CatBoost поддерживает распараллеливание и может работать с различными типами данных."
